# Wastewater-Concentration-Predict

## **Introduction**
The Wastewater-Concentration-Predict project is focused on accurately forecasting wastewater concentration levels using advanced deep learning techniques. In this project, we have explored various Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq), and Transformer architectures. Our efforts have resulted in a model capable of predicting wastewater concentration with a high degree of accuracy, achieving an R-square value of 0.94 for predictions made 20 minutes into the future.

## **Background**
Effective management and treatment of wastewater are critical to environmental sustainability and public health. Predicting wastewater concentration in real-time is a complex challenge due to the highly dynamic and non-linear nature of the underlying processes. Traditional methods often fall short in providing the necessary accuracy for short-term predictions, which are crucial for timely decision-making in wastewater treatment facilities.

With the advent of deep learning, particularly RNNs, it has become possible to model temporal dependencies in time-series data more effectively. LSTM, Seq2Seq, and Transformer models have shown promise in various forecasting tasks, offering the ability to capture complex patterns and improve predictive performance. This project aims to leverage these state-of-the-art techniques to enhance the prediction of wastewater concentration, providing a robust tool for environmental engineers and decision-makers.
